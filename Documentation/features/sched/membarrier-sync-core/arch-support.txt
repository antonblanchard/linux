#         description:   arch supports core serializing membarrier
#
# Architecture requirements
#
# If your architecture returns to user-space through non-core-serializing
# instructions, you need to ensure these are done in switch_mm and exit_lazy_tlb
# (if lazy tlb switching is implemented).
#
# * arm/arm64
#
# Rely on implicit context synchronization as a result of exception return
# when returning from IPI handler, and when returning to user-space.
#
# * x86
#
# x86-32 uses IRET as return from interrupt, which takes care of the IPI.
# However, it uses both IRET and SYSEXIT to go back to user-space. The IRET
# instruction is core serializing, but not SYSEXIT.
#
# x86-64 uses IRET as return from interrupt, which takes care of the IPI.
# However, it can return to user-space through either SYSRETL (compat code),
# SYSRETQ, or IRET.
#
# Given that neither SYSRET{L,Q}, nor SYSEXIT, are core serializing, we rely
# instead on write_cr3() performed by switch_mm() to provide core serialization
# after changing the current mm, and deal with the special case of kthread ->
# uthread (temporarily keeping current mm into active_mm) by issuing a
# serializing instruction in exit_lazy_mm() in that specific case.
